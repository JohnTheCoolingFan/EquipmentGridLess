equipment-grid-upscale=Increasing this value increases the grid-less-ness of your equipment "field".\nHigher values cause increased load when on screen!.
equipment-grid-leeway=Enable to slightly decrease the equipment's size and increase the size of the grid.
equipment-pill-shape=Make equipment have a shape of a pill or a cirle.\n\nSo that's where I left them!
