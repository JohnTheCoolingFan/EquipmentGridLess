# Equipment GridLess

Ever felt limited by the limitations of the grid for your armor and vehicle equipment?

Ever wondered if it's possible to free yourself from the shackles of the grid?

Well, you can't. But you can get very close!

Introducing Equipment GridLess - it increass the equipment grid resolution to a point where it's almost unnoticeable. It's still there, but all thsoe jagged edges are upscaled away ~~using latest upscaling technology from <your GPU vendor>~~. It even works on all devices!

# Settings

The mod has a few startup options that you can change to tweak your GridLessâ„¢ experience:

### Equipment Gridlessifying ratio

Increases the amount by which the size of the grid and equipment is multiplied. Higher numbers can cause decreased performance when the equipment menu is open.

Default: 8

### Equipment leeway/gaps

Adds a little bit of space to the grid and makes the equipment slightly smaller. Can be useful for higher gridless ratios.

Default: enabled

### Equipment pills

Makes equipment have a circular or pill shape for extra fun.

Default: enabled
